Just hold your breath and see, when the time is right
birds will fly at your face.

Stand on one hand and lift

Now breathe.
That's good.

(Weehoo)
One day I was walkin' and I found this big log
And I rolled the log over and underneath was a tiny little stick,
and I was like, "That log had a child."
Hmmm
Listen boy, someday when you are older
you could get hit by a boulder.
While you're lyin' there screamin',
"Come help me please, " the seagulls
HMM
Poke your knees!
Hmm hah hmm hmm hmm hah hmm hmm ha
Hmm hmm hmm hm ha hmm hm hm hm ha
Stop it now!
Hmm hah hmm hmm hmm hah hmm hmm ha
